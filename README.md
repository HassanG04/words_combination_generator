# Word Variants Generator

I created this tool to help me moderate my discord server,It might be useful if you want to create a document with all combinations of certain words and you can do whatever you want with it!
## What it does:
This program reads words from a `words.txt` file and generates various combinations by manipulating character cases and replacing certain letters with similar-looking symbols.

## Features
- Reads input from words.txt
- Generates multiple variants of each word
- Supports case variations (upper/lower)
- Replaces letters with similar symbols:
    - 'a' → '@'
    - 'e' → '3'
    - 'i' → '1'
    - 'o' → '0'
    - 's' → '$'

## Example
Input word: "cat"
Some possible outputs:
- cat
- Cat
- CAT
- c@t
- C@t
- C@T
- cAt
- cAT

## Usage
1. Create a words.txt file with your input words.
2. Run the program whether you run it by opening CMD in the folder and typing python GC.py or just running it through a compiler.
3. Get all possible combinations as output.

<h6> You can use it for: <br>
1. Password creation (i.e you can put your normal password and choose a password you like whilst writing it down on a note)<br>
2. Creating a moderation app that uses this to censor certain words.<br>
3. More stuff idk...?</h6>
